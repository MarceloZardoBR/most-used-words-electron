‭a paragon of legal ethics.

You're welcome.

If it comes down to it, one day,
I hope you will, too.

I thought I already had.

901
00:40:16,829 --> 00:40:20,364
You did. And it saved me.

902

It's about my will and my various trusts.

I'd like you to set aside a time

You're giving a cop
the keys to your kingdom.

Regrettably.

- Why do it?

Because where she's going,
she'll need it.
